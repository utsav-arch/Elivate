<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build an enterprise-grade Customer Success Management (CSM) platform named Convin Elevate, inspired by Vitally.io. The detailed requirements are provided in a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD v2.0).

The platform should support multiple user roles (CSM, AM, CS Leadership, CS Ops, Sales) with specific permissions and data visibility scopes.

Key modules to be built include:
1.  **Customer Data Management:** A 360° view of customer accounts with extensive details.
2.  **CSM Activity & Risk Logging:** Systematic tracking of interactions and proactive risk management.
3.  **Opportunity Tracking:** Manage upsell, cross-sell, and renewal opportunities.
4.  **Task Management:** Create, assign, and track tasks related to customer accounts.
5.  **Data Labs Reports:** Track custom analytics reports sent to customers.
6.  **Document Management:** Secure, version-controlled storage for account-specific documents.
7.  **Dashboard & Analytics:** Role-specific dashboards with real-time insights.
8.  **Reporting & Exports:** A custom report builder with scheduling capabilities.
9.  **Settings & Configuration:** Comprehensive system administration.
10. **User & Role Management:** Manage users, roles, and the CSM-to-AM hierarchy.

The project is being developed in phases. The current focus is on **Phase 1**, which includes:
-   Task Management module.
-   Data Labs Reports module.
-   Enhanced navigation sidebar.
-   Advanced health score logic.
-   Initial role-based visibility (CSM vs. AM).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB database) for a CSM tool. The initial MVP with Customer, Activity, Risk, and Opportunity management is complete. The database is populated with rich, realistic dummy data for Convin.ai, including 30 customers and 10 CSMs across three regions in India. A JWT authentication system is in place, and a critical  bug has been fixed. The implementation of Phase 1 has begun, with backend APIs for Tasks and Data Labs created and frontend pages scaffolded. However, the frontend is currently not compiling due to a syntax error.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing a new UI layout component, , to match the detailed sidebar navigation specified in the new PRD (v2.0).
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Frontend Compilation Failure (P0)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** The frontend application fails to compile due to a syntax error in . The agent previously identified and attempted to fix an issue with Unicode escape characters but the syntax error persists.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** A  command was used to fix an initial error, but it was insufficient and a syntax error remains.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  View the full content of .
        2.  Identify and correct the remaining syntax error(s). Common causes could be unclosed JSX tags, misplaced characters, or incorrect template literal syntax.
        3.  Restart the frontend service: frontend: stopped
frontend: ERROR (abnormal termination).
        4.  Use the  to confirm the application loads without compilation errors.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a blocking issue. The entire frontend is down. Fixing it will unblock all further UI development and testing for Phase 1.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Complete Phase 1 Implementation (P0)

**Task Detail**:
-   **Task 1:**
    -   **Where to resume:** After resolving the frontend compilation error (Issue 1).
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will deliver the first major set of features from the new PRD, including Task Management, Data Labs Reports, and an enhanced navigation UI, making the tool significantly more functional.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on something:** Issue 1: Frontend Compilation Failure.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (Phase 2):**
    -   **P1:** Implement the Document Management module as per the PRD (file uploads, versioning, folder structure).
    -   **P1:** Implement Custom Views and Advanced Filtering on all list pages (Customers, Tasks, etc.).

-   **Future Tasks (Phase 3):**
    -   **P2:** Implement the full Settings & Configuration module.
    -   **P2:** Build the custom Report Builder and scheduling engine.
    -   **P2:** Integrate with external services like HubSpot, Email, and Calendar as specified in the PRD.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Recently completed:**
    -   Initial MVP of the CSM tool (Customer, Activity, Risk, and Opportunity modules).
    -   Created and executed a database seeding script () with realistic data for Convin.ai.
    -   Fixed a critical  error by implementing a frontend Axios interceptor and increasing the JWT token lifespan.
    -   Created backend APIs for the Task Management and Data Labs Reports modules.
    -   Scaffolded frontend components for Phase 1 (, , , ).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent has addressed all user-reported issues so far.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (via Motor), JWT for authentication.
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios (with interceptors), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components.
-   **DevOps:** Docker, Supervisor for process management.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** 
-   **customers:** 
-   **activities:** 
-   **risks:** 
-   **opportunities:** 
-   **tasks:** 
-   **datalabs_reports:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-   The user's PRD suggested a PostgreSQL database, but the agent opted to use the existing MongoDB setup.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all backend logic, models, and API endpoints. Recently updated with Task and DataLabsReport models/APIs.
-   : The new, currently broken layout component that needs to be fixed.
-   : Contains the frontend routing logic and Axios configuration, including the 401 error interceptor.
-   : Contains the logic for populating the database with realistic test data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is over 800 lines long and contains all models and endpoints. It should be refactored into a more modular structure using FastAPI's  to separate logic for each entity (e.g., , ).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The project's requirements are now dictated by the **very detailed v2.0 PRD** (from chat message 122), not the initial problem statement.
-   You are in the middle of a user-approved **3-phase implementation plan**. The immediate goal is to complete **Phase 1**.
-   **The frontend is currently broken.** Your first task is to fix the compilation error in .
-   After fixing the UI, you must test the newly added Task and Data Labs Report features and the updated navigation.
-   A crucial part of Phase 1, **role-based visibility** (CSM vs. AM), has not been implemented yet and should be the next major step after the UI is working.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The entire frontend is non-functional due to a compilation error.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin:**  / 
-   **CSM Users:** Multiple CSM users exist (e.g., , ). All use the password .

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has not yet implemented the role-based visibility aspect of the agreed-upon Phase 1 plan (distinguishing what CSMs vs. AMs can see). This is a critical next step after the immediate bug fix.</analysis>
